### This is an Chrome Extension
- Helps you to skip the course videos on Course HUST

## How to use
- Install & Enable the extension
- Use other extensions to intercept the webpage's request for `videojs-ext.min.js?v=2025-0212-2100` and redirect it to the content as shown in the file in this repo with the identical name
- Play the video on the course page, **don't move the mouse**, sit back and relax, and wait for the magic to happen
- If the course is still not marked as completed 30 seconds after the video starts, consider refreshing the page

## DISCLAIMER
